                    <h3>Most famous Flan</h3>
                </hgroup>
                <strong>Ingredients</strong>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup sugar, divided</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                    <li>4 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                </ul>
                <br>  
                <strong>Directions</strong>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Stir 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes. Divide caramel among six 3/4-cup custard cups. Working quickly, tilt cups, coating bottoms and part of sides.
                    Stir milk and 1/2 cup sugar in medium saucepan over low heat just until sugar dissolves (milk will be lukewarm). Whisk eggs in medium bowl until blended. Slowly whisk in milk mixture. Whisk in vanilla and salt. Strain custard into prepared cups.
                    Arrange cups in 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake flans until just set in center, about 50 minutes. Remove cups from water and let stand 30 minutes. Chill until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.
                </p>
                <p>To serve, cut around the sides of each cup to loosen flan; turn out onto a plate and enjoy!  </p>

                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions</strong>
                <br>
                <p>
                        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray a 9x13'' pan with non-stick cooking spray.
                        In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Separate the eggs into two separate bowls.
                        Add 3/4 cup sugar to the bowl with the egg yolks and mix on high speed until yolks are pale yellow. Add the 1/3 cup milk and vanilla and stir to combine. 
                        
                        Pour the egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and stir gently just until combined (don't over-mix).
                        
                        Use electric beaters to beat the egg whites on high speed. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar as you mix and continue beating until stiff peaks.
                        Fold egg whites into the batter gently, just until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Make sure to smooth it into an even layer so your baked cake doesn't have divots in it.
                        Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow cake to cool completely.
                        
                        Combine the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and whole milk in a small bowl. Once the cake has cooled use a fork to poke holes all over the top of the cake. 
                        
                        Slowly pour the milk mixture over the the top of the cake, making sure to pour near the edges and all around.
                        
                        Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour or overnight, to allow it to soak up the milk.
                        In the meantime, whip the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks. Smooth over the top of the cake. Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Serve with fresh sliced strawberries, if desired. Enjoy!
