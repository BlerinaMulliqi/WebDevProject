                    <h3>Wagoners’ Rice</h3>
                </hgroup>
                <strong>Ingredients</strong>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 cups (760 g) uncooked jasmine rice or parboiled rice </li>
                    <li>2 thick slices bacon, chopped or cubed</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons (45 ml) olive oil</li>
                    <li>4 cups (approximately 1⁄2 kilo) chopped or cubed leftover grilled beef,
                        preferably with some char marks and fat (dried beef can also be used)</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
                    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                    <li>1⁄2 cup chopped green onions, green and white parts </li>
                    <li>Dash of crushed red pepper</li>
                    <li>1–2 cubes beef bouillon</li>
                    <li>6 cups hot water, plus more as needed</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Fresh Italian parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
                    <li>Grated Parmesan, for garnish</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Directions</strong>
                <br>
                <p>If using jasmine rice, prior to cooking, rinse the dry rice with water in a mixing bowl,
                     straining the water until it runs clear to remove any excessive starch. Drain well and reserve.</p>
                <p>Render the bacon in the oil in a 4- to 6-quart cast-iron pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat 
                       until golden brown. Add the beef, garlic, and onion, and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
                       Stir in the rice and sauté for 2 minutes, then add green onions, red pepper, beef bouillon, and water;
                       add salt if needed. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about
                       20 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed the water. If the water has been completely absorbed but
                       the rice is still undercooked, add a bit more water and allow it to cook a little longer.</p>
                <p>When the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and gently stir it with a spoon so that all the ingredients
                        are well mixed. Cover the pot with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 2 to 3 minutes.
                        Just before serving, garnish the rice with the parsley and Parmesan</p>
                <p>If you remove the lid and allow the rice to cook for 5 to 7 minutes at a low temperature, 
                       the bottom of the rice will form a nice crust that is extremely flavorful.
                       To create the crust without burning the dish, it is imperative to use a heavy cast-iron pot</p>
